║ Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to    ║
║ get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to  ║
║ program.                                                           ║

## Steps

1. Observation ( Understand the problem )

- Identify any constraints or guarantees given in the problem (e.g., input size, ranges, properties of the data).

2. Hypothesis ( Assumption & Forming a solution )

- **Assumption**: Make logical assumptions about how the solution could behave based on the input.
- **Forming a Solution**: Based on these assumptions, devise a plan or approach to solve the problem. This might involve:
  - Choosing an algorithm (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming, graph traversal).
  - Deciding on data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, sets, trees) that best fit the problem requirements.
  - Developing pseudocode or outlining steps to implement the solution.

3. Proof ( Verifying hypothesis correctness & efficiency )

Try the **Hypothesis** on many edge cases.
