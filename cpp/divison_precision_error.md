# Division Precision Error

In C++, to avoid precision errors while working with division, especially when dealing with `int` and `float` types together, you can multiply by the inverse of a number instead of dividing by it. This keeps the calculation in the integer domain.

For example, if you're dividing by `2 * n`, instead of doing:

```cpp
float result = a / (2 * n);
```

You can multiply by the reciprocal to avoid floating-point arithmetic:

```cpp
float result = a * (1.0f / (2 * n));
```
